# Welcome!
This is a cross compiler based on the DJGPP DOS development system for use on Windows. If you want to use it, just unzip the root.zip file to your working directory. The compiler has the following programs:

* **Wget 1.11.4**

The compiler has the following MS-DOS compatible libraries:

If you have any problem regarding the compiler, feel free to ask me. The repository updates will not be completely constant, since I am still in college, but this does not mean that this will leave it in oblivion.
